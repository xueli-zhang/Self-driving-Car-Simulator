# Project Name: Self-driving Car Simulator

## Purpose:
    The purpose of this project is creating a simulator framework to help testing autopilot software

## Concepts:
    This simulator is going to simulate a real world traffic situation with trained nuronal networks:

## Simulate Scenarios:
### 1. Parking:
**1.** System will generate a random parking map, holes, vechicles, and pedestrians:
**PASS** standard:
*       Not hitting vechicles
*       Not hitting pedestrians
*       Not hitting walls
*       Not dropping to holes
*       Successfully detected available parking space
*       Successfully parking to empty space
