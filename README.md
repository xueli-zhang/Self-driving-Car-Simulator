# Project Name: Self-driving Car Simulator

## Purpose:
    The purpose of this project is creating a simulator framework to help testing autopilot software

## Concepts:
    This simulator is going to simulate real world traffic scenarios with trained nuronal networks:

## Simulate Scenarios:
### 1. Parking:
* **1-1.** System will generate a random parking map, holes, vechicles, and pedestrians by the Parking Simulator Nuronal Network:
  * **PASS** standard:
    * Not hitting vechicles
    * Not hitting pedestrians
    * Not hitting walls
    * Not dropping to holes
    * Successfully detected available parking space
    * Successfully parking to empty space
